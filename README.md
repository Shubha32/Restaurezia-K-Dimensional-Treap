# Restaurezia-K-Dimensional-Treap
•Restaurezia, an application that searches for restaurants that exist in the user’s location and if restaurants are not found in that location, suitable suggestions that are in the nearby locations are displayed. The implementation of this application is based on the fusion of binary search tree and heap, extended to k dimensions.
